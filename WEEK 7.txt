This is same game returned for both the week 7
 task and the project since there was never 
 made a version that would be just the week 7 requirements.
It should contain all the requirements for week 7 aswell.

1. It is a game, the start was done following the lecture video example.
2. There are moving enemies and also 2 types of collectibles, as well as falling platforms.
3. Player can "communicate" with the enemies by killing them by 
    clicking when close enough (but not too close to be hit)
